# openai-api-simulator

This is a very primitive simulator of https://api.openai.com/v1/completions. It exists to support
[ReactGirls](https://reactgirls.com/) lectures.

The text in 2701-0.txt is the full text of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale; specifically, it is downloaded from
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701) and then stripped to start immediately with the first chapter.
